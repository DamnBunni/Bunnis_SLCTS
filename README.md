# Bunni's Secret Laboratory:Custom Translation

A custom translation for SCP:Secret Laboratory created by Bunni.

This translation is heavily customized, if you're not into that then don't use this but if you do like having everything be colorful as fuck then try it out, you might like it.

# Current Version: 1.3
Updates will occasionally be released, the translation is up-to-date for 14.1.

**Things you should expect in this custom translation are:**
* Colored inventory item names.
* Edited inventory item names.
* Different colors for each SCP role.
* A handful of pink themed menus.
* Better and colored subtitles.
* Over 100 custom loading hints.
* A ton of other small changes.
* Round summary changes. (Currently in the works of changing it completely)
* Keycard item name changes. (not inventory, this future is exclusive to 14.1)
* Legacy interface changes. (Eg. Rank displays when hovering over Guard or MTF soldier.)
* Item Description changes. (Not finished yet, needs a complete re-do)
* SCP-079 Interface color overhaul.
* Small Remote Admin color changes.
* Door Panel changes (Exclusive to 14.0, will be removed once 14.1 is fully released.)
* 14.1 Support.
**And much more to arrive.**
